# Downloading the installer
Once you have the installer.zip downloaded, extract its contents to a folder (or just your downloads directory)

<br><br>
Then you should be left with these files

<br><br>

# Downloading mods
Open the installer folder and run the installer.exe
<br>

(If you get prompted by windows defender, press "more info" and run anyway)

You should be met by this screen

<br><br>
**Before you jump right ahead**, if you have any mods then extract their contents and make sure the files are only one folder deep (just press extract all like with the installer and no issues should arise)
<br><br>For example, if I were to download a mod named "coolmod", when I extract the zip file I will get a folder that contains all the mod contents, not a folder that contains a folder which itself the contents of the mod

Adding mods to install
---

Place all your mod folders in the folder: "loaderfiles/mods" which contains a single file ending in DELETEME
<br><br>

<br><br>
E.g if i wanted to install 3 mods i would put all the extracted folders in here:
<br><br>

<br><br>

Now that all of your mod folders are in the correct place, reopen the console window that the installer.exe created and press enter to begin the installation process
<br><br>
If everything has gone correctly so far you should see this:

<br><br>
Type y or Y and press enter and the installer will also add your mods

<br><br>
And we're done!
<br><br>Make sure you read the README file for each mod you download for more information on the mod's config, which you can modify by following the instructions given by that mod, usually by locating a file named "mod_list.lua" in the Primordialis game files

# Uninstalling and re-Patching
Whenever the game updates, you might notice your mods stop working. To fix this, simply start the installer.exe file, type p or P and press enter, then restart your game.

To uninstall, start the installer.exe type u or U and the mod installer will undo any modifications to Primordialis.
