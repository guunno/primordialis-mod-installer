# Primordialis Lua Mod Loader
This allows you to easily install and use lua mods, which can register new creatures and control their ai
## Installing
To install add this to your scripts folder, so the path should look like data/scripts/lua_mods/README.md

**Do not name the folder lua_mods-main**

Then add the following the very start of your data/scripts/init.lua (so that it's the first line)
```lua
dofile("data/scripts/lua_mods/pre.lua")
```
Then this to the end of data/scripts/init.lua (so that it's the last line)
```lua
dofile("data/scripts/lua_mods/post.lua")
```
## Getting mods
Currently only the example mod exists, but when there are new mods made you should add them to the mods folder so that the path looks like data/scripts/lua_mods/mods/mod_id/init.lua
Then to enable the mods edit data/scripts/lua_mods/mod_list.lua to add them to the table
## Making mods
To make a mod the easiest the way is to copy the way example mod does things, the general idea is you register your callback in pre or post, then in that callback you shadow some of the vanilla functions to also do your content.
When you upload a mod to github you should tag it with the tag "primordialis" this makes it easier for people to find your mod.
